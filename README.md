# Algorithm Engineering

The *{First,Second}Part.pdf* here contains my notes, taken during lessons. I had to split due to the Github limit of 100 MBs for single files (it's quite high resolution, you can easily zoom in to see better!)

The teacher's notes are available at his [site](http://didawiki.di.unipi.it/doku.php/magistraleinformaticanetworking/ae/ae2019/start)
